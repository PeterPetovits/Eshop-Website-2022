# Eshop-Website-2022

This repo contains two projects as assignments for CS Web Developement cource. 
The first one starts as a simple web eshop in order to learn the basics of html and css. In the next phases we added flex/grid and at the end we added media rules for different types of devices-screens (plus a little bit of JS).

The second project is a web wiki eshop that we practised JS and fetch requests in a database (Atlas Mongo db). We implemented a simple login (username and password + unique session id per login), cart with cart fetching and dynamic content with Handlebars.
